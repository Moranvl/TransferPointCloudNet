# Abstract
In recent years, there has been a notable surge in investment interest in the establishment of Digital Twin (DT) shopfloors, underscoring the growing importance of DT technology. As such, there has been a heightened demand for the creation of DT models. Nevertheless, manual operations continue to play a significant role in the construction process, irrespective of time and financial considerations. Hence, it is imperative to develop an approach for the rapid construction of DT shopfloors aimed at reducing the reliance on manual operations. To this end, a point cloud based expeditious construction framework for DT shopfloors was proposed in the present study, which comprises pre-processing, processing, and post-processing modules. The pre-processing module is responsible for providing a clear point cloud to the processing module, and the post-processing module will reuse a historical DT model directly or establish a new one manually according to the result from the processing module. To achieve the task of determining whether a reusable model exists and which model to reuse for the post-processing module based on the input clear point cloud, the Transfer Point Cloud Net (TPCN) is employed as the processing network, comprising multiple enhanced Transformer blocks. Additionally, it demonstrates the capability to transfer knowledge derived from publicly available datasets, thereby diminishing the need for reliance on proprietary industrial data for training purposes. Moreover, this capacity can reduce the number of parameters necessary for training TPCN, leading to substantial time and computational resource savings. Comparative experiments were also conducted to validate the performance of the TPCN.
